<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tiramisu is a classic Italian dessert that combines layers of delicate ladyfingers soaked in strong coffee with the
    velvety texture of mascarpone cheese, all dusted with a generous sprinkling of cocoa powder.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>400ml double cream</li>
    <li>250g mascarpone</li>
    <li>75ml marsala</li>
    <li>5 tbsp golden caster sugar</li>
    <li>300ml coffee, made with 2 tbsp coffee granules and 300ml boiling water</li>
    <li>175g sponge fingers</li>
    <li>25g dark chocolate</li>
    <li>2 tsp cocoa powder</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>Put the double cream, mascarpone, marsala, and golden caster sugar in a large bowl. Whisk until the cream and
        mascarpone have completely combined and have the consistency of thickly whipped cream.</li>
    <li>Pour the coffee into a shallow dish. Dip in a few of the sponge fingers at a time, turning for a few seconds
        until they are nicely soaked, but not soggy. Layer these in a dish until you've used half the sponge fingers,
        then spread over half of the creamy mixture.</li>
    <li>Using the coarse side of the grater, grate over most of the dark chocolate. Then repeat the layers (you should
        use up all the coffee), finishing with the creamy layer.</li>
    <li>Cover and chill for a few hours or overnight. Will keep in the fridge for up to two days.</li>
    <li>To serve, dust with cocoa powder and grate over the remainder of the chocolate.</li>
</ol>
